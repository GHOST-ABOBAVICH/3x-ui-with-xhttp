# How to connect to your server via SHH connection
___
### Server purchase

First of all, you must purchase a VPS/VDS server on any site you prefer; there is no particular difference here.
___

### Profile

In your profile, after purchase, you will see your ip login which is root by default and a generated password. You need to take this data and write it down, for example, in [Termius](https://termius.com/download/windows), a convenient client for me. You can use whatever you like.
___
### Termius

After you install and log into the application you need to:
- Go to Hosts.
- In the left corner there will be the inscription NEW HOST.
- In the Address field: your server ip.
- Do not touch the port; let the standard 22 stand.
- Username: root.
- Password: your password that was generated.
___
### Also, if you want, in the General group you can set up:
- The name of the server that will be displayed for you.
- Group if you have many of them.
- Tag.
___
### After clicking connect and that's it, you are connected, congratulations!
